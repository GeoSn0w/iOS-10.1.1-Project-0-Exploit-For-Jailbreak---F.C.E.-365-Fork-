# iOS 10.1.1 Project 0 Exploit FORK with More Device Offsets!

This is the Google's Project 0 exploits for iOS 10.1.1 modified a <b>little</b> bit. 
The exploits from Project 0 basically are for: Sandbox escaping and ROOT SHELL access, therefore, 90% of a jailbreak.
This project contains support for all x64 devices and I redesigned the white app page to tell the user he should be focusing on the Xcode Debug terminal not on the phone. Also there is a notification that the fork is not the original project.

So basically the main changes compared to the official Project 0 are:

* Compatibility with all 64bit devices
* Redesigned iOS app page (instead of white screen, it tells the user he should focus on the Xcode Debug Terminal).
* Better notifications when a known device is detected - Partially (still working on some devices).
 So instead of "found iphone7,1" it will say "I detected an iPhone 6 that matched". (Not very important indeed, just for cosmetic reasons).
 
Please check out the official documentation and the official project here:https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=965
 
A tutorial on how to modify the offsets or how to use this project is available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5YeGyNMP8E
 
 SPEACIAL THANKS TO Reddit/Jailbreak Community for parts of the offset list.
